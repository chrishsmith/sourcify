2. `src/app/api/tariff-tracker/route.ts` - API endpoint with filters
3. `src/features/compliance/components/TariffTrackerContent.tsx` - Main component (~865 lines)
4. `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/compliance/tariff-tracker/page.tsx` - Page wrapper

**Modified Files:**

2. `prd.json` - Marked P1-010 as passes: true
3. `progress.txt` - Added learnings

## Features Implemented

All acceptance criteria met:
- Tariff tracker page at `/dashboard/compliance/tariff-tracker`
- Section 301 lists breakdown (List 1-4A/B with rates: 25%, 25%, 25%, 7.5%, 25-100%)
- IEEPA tariffs by country (CN: 125%+, MX: 25%, CA: 25%, VN: 46%, etc.)
