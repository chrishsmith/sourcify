I've completed the implementation for **P2-001** (Landed Cost Calculator) and **P2-002** (Customs Fees). Here's a summary:

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created
1. **Page**: `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/duties/calculator/page.tsx`
2. **Component**: `src/features/compliance/components/LandedCostCalculator.tsx` (~530 lines)
3. **API**: `src/app/api/landed-cost/route.ts` (~220 lines)

### Files Modified
1. **DashboardLayout**: Added Calculator menu item for "Landed Cost"
2. **prd.json**: Marked P2-001 and P2-002 as `passes: true`
3. **progress.txt**: Added learnings

### Features Implemented
- **Form inputs**: HTS code, country (18 options), product value, quantity, shipping cost, insurance cost
- **Ocean/Air toggle**: Switch component affects HMF calculation
- **Duties breakdown**: Base MFN + Additional duties with effective rate
- **Fees breakdown**: MPF (0.3464%, $31.67-$614.35) and HMF (0.125% ocean only)
- **Total landed cost**: With per-unit cost when quantity > 1
- **TariffBreakdown reuse**: Shows full duty details using existing component
