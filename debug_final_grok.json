Step 2: Based on the material (polyurethane foam, a plastic), Chapter 39 (Plastics and Articles Thereof) is the most relevant chapter per Section VII notes. Step 3: Chapters 38 (chemical mixtures), 42 (leather articles), 48 (paper products), 62 (garments), 64 (footwear), 80 (tin articles), 85 (electrical machinery), 90 (optical instruments), 94 (furniture and lighting), and 98 (special provisions) are eliminated as they do not relate to articles of plastic for hearing protection; their scopes cover unrelated products like chemicals, clothing, footwear, or specific machinery. Step 4: Within Chapter 39, Heading 3926 covers 'Other articles of plastics and articles of other materials of headings 3901 to 3914,' which includes miscellaneous plastic articles not specified elsewhere. Subheading notes do not exclude ear plugs. Step 5: Subheadings 3926.90.9400 (cards for jacquard machines) and 3926.20.6000 (plastic rainwear) are eliminated as their descriptions explicitly contradict the product’s form and use. Step 6: Subheading 3926.90.9940 (covers, rings, frames, etc.) remains as the most specific under 'Other' for miscellaneous plastic articles, fitting the product as a general plastic item for hearing protection (GRI 3(a)). Step 7: No further tie exists, and 'Other' is appropriate as no more specific subheading applies.","warnings":["✓ HTS code verified against official USITC database","Confidence is high but could be revisited if specific provisions for hearing protection articles are identified in other chapters or headings.","⚠️ Additional duties from China: +45% on top of base rate"],"createdAt":"2025-12-19T22:56:40.249Z","humanReadablePath":"Chapter 39 › Heading 3926 › Covers, rings and frames for manholes; catch basins; drainage gates and frames thereof; cleanout covers and frames thereof; valve, service and meter boxes","effectiveTariff":{"baseHtsCode":"3926.90.99.40","htsDescription":"Covers, rings and frames for manholes; catch basins; drainage gates and frames thereof; cleanout covers and frames thereof; valve, service and meter boxes","countryOfOrigin":"CN","destinationCountry":"US","baseMfnRate":{"rate":"See USITC","rateType":"ad_valorem"},"additionalDuties":[{"htsCode":"9903.01.24","programName":"IEEPA Fentanyl Tariff","programType":"ieepa_fentanyl","rate":{"rate":"10%","rateType":"ad_valorem","numericRate":10},"authority":"IEEPA / Executive Order","legalReference":"Executive Order 14195","effectiveDate":"2025-02-04","applicable":true,"description":"Additional 10% tariff on goods from China related to fentanyl crisis response.
