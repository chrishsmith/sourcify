# Naming Conventions Rule for Sourcify

## Folder Names
- Use **kebab-case** for all folders (lowercase with hyphens)
  - Good: classification-flow, trade-intelligence, user-auth
  - Bad: ClassificationFlow, classificationFlow, CLASSIFICATION_FLOW

## File Names
- React/TSX components → **PascalCase**.tsx
  - Good: ClassificationTable.tsx, BulkClassificationForm.tsx
- Utility functions, hooks, helpers → **camelCase**.ts / .tsx
  - Good: formatClassificationResult.ts, useClassification.ts
- Pages / route handlers (in app/) → **kebab-case** for folders, page.tsx or layout.tsx inside
  - Good: app/classification-flow/page.tsx
- Markdown docs (in docs/) → **kebab-case**.md
  - Good: prd-trade-intelligence.md, competitive-analysis-datamyne.md
  - Rename existing SCREAMING_CASE files during refactors
- Prisma schema & migrations → keep as Prisma defaults (schema.prisma, migrations/ numbered folders)
- Seed scripts → camelCase or kebab-case (e.g. seed-classification-data.ts)

## Variable / Function Names
- Variables, functions, hooks → **camelCase**
- Constants → **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** (especially env vars, magic numbers)
- Types / Interfaces → **PascalCase**
- Enum members → **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** or PascalCase (consistency within file)

## When Suggesting or Creating Files
- Always propose the full path with correct naming (e.g. features/classification/components/ClassificationResultTable.tsx)
- If I suggest a bad name, gently correct it and explain (e.g. "Prefer kebab-case for folders: features/classification-flow/...")
- During refactors, rename files/folders to match these conventions and update all imports/references

This keeps the codebase readable, searchable, and modern while moving fast.
