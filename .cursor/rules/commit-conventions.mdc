# Commit & Branch Conventions Rule for Vibe Coding

## Commit Messages
Use **Conventional Commits** format for clean history and auto-changelogs:

<type>(<scope>): <short description>

Types (pick one):
- feat:     new feature / capability
- fix:      bug fix
- refactor: code restructure (no behavior change)
- docs:     documentation only
- style:    formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- test:     adding or correcting tests
- chore:    maintenance (deps, tooling)
- perf:     performance improvement

Scope: optional, e.g. classification, prisma, ui, auth, docs

Examples (perfect for fast iteration):
- feat(classification): add bulk classification endpoint
- fix: handle null result in ClassificationTable
- docs: update prd-trade-intelligence with new paid tier
- refactor(services): extract classification engine to ClassificationService
- chore(deps): upgrade prisma to latest

Keep subject line < 72 chars. Add body if needed for why/how.

## Branch Names
For quick features / fixes (vibe-coding friendly):
- feature/<kebab-case-description>     e.g. feature/add-premium-tier-check
- fix/<kebab-case-bug>                 e.g. fix/classification-null-crash
- refactor/<area>                      e.g. refactor/services-layer
- docs/<topic>                         e.g. docs/update-roadmap-2026
- spike/<experiment>                   (delete after)

Main branches:
- main → production / releases
- develop → integration (optional)

## Workflow Tips for Fast Iteration
- Commit often (every 5-20 min or logical chunk)
- Use small, atomic commits — easier to revert during vibes
- Squash messy branches before merging to main
- When suggesting Git commands or reviewing changes, remind me of these conventions

This keeps Git history clean without slowing down rapid prototyping.
