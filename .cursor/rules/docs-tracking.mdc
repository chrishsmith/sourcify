# Documentation & Progress Tracking Rule for Sourcify

## Central Files
- **docs/PROGRESS.md** (or **docs/TODO.md**): Single source of truth for current status
  - Use checklists: - [ ] / - [x]
  - Sections: In Progress, Done This Week, Backlog, Blocked
  - Update on every major commit or feature completion

- **docs/roadmap.md** or **docs/product-roadmap.md**: High-level milestones & quarterly goals
- **docs/prd-*.md**: One PRD per major feature/module (kebab-case naming)
  - Include: Vision, Goals, Success Metrics, Competitive Notes, Open Questions
- **docs/changelog.md**: Auto-buildable from conventional commits (or manual appends)

## How to Track During Vibe Coding
When I create or mention a new feature / task:
- Suggest adding a line to docs/PROGRESS.md (e.g. "- [ ] Implement premium tier upsell flow")
- If completing something: Suggest checking it off + adding to Done section
- For big features: Suggest creating docs/prd-<feature-name>.md with basic template

## Template for New PRDs / Feature Docs
When creating a new .md in docs/:
Start with:

```markdown
# PRD: <Feature Name>

**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** DRAFT / In Progress / Done  
**Owner:** Product / Engineering  

## 1. Vision & Goals

## 2. Success Metrics

## 3. Competitive Positioning

## 4. Requirements / Stories

## 5. Open Questions / Risks

## 6. Related Docs
