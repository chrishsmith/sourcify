Story **P1-008 - Build FTA Qualification Calculator** is complete. Here's the summary:

## Implementation Complete

### Files Created:
1. **API** - `src/app/api/fta-calculator/route.ts` (~400 lines)
   - POST: Calculate FTA qualification (RVC, tariff shift analysis)
   - GET: Fetch FTA agreements list

2. **Component** - `src/features/compliance/components/FTAQualificationCalculator.tsx` (~1150 lines)
   - Product info card (HTS code, FTA selection, transaction value)
   - BOM management (add/edit/delete components)
   - RVC calculation with circular progress
   - Tariff shift analysis table
   - Pass/fail result with explanation
   - Duty savings display
   - Save/load BOM to localStorage

3. **Page** - `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/compliance/fta-calculator/page.tsx`

4. **Navigation** - Updated `DashboardLayout.tsx` with ClipboardCheck icon "FTA Calculator"

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- ✅ FTA calculator at /dashboard/compliance/fta-calculator
- ✅ User enters HTS code and selects FTA
- ✅ System shows applicable rule of origin
- ✅ User inputs Bill of Materials (component, HTS, origin country, value)
- ✅ Calculator determines RVC percentage and tariff shift compliance
- ✅ Clear pass/fail result with explanation
- ✅ Shows duty savings if qualified vs MFN rate
- ✅ Save BOM for future reference (localStorage)

### Manual Steps Required:
The build and git commands were rejected by the sandbox. Please run:

```bash
cd /Users/smithchrish/Projects/sourcify
npm run build
git add -A && git commit -m "feat(P1-008): Build FTA Qualification Calculator

- Add FTA qualification calculator at /dashboard/compliance/fta-calculator
- Support RVC calculation (transaction, net_cost, build_down, build_up methods)
- Tariff shift analysis (CC/CTH/CTSH/CTI) for BOM components
- Show pass/fail with duty savings estimate
- Save/load BOMs to localStorage"
```
