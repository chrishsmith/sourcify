# Sourcify Development Progress

## Project Initialized: January 19, 2026

### Initial State Analysis

**What's Working:**
- Authentication with Better Auth (email/password + Google OAuth)
- HTS classification engine (V10) with confidence scoring
- Full HTS database imported from USITC
- Tariff calculation with Section 301, IEEPA, base MFN rates
- Basic dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
- Supplier database schema (needs data population)

**What Needs Work:**
- Saved products functionality (schema exists, UI incomplete)
- Search history (schema exists, UI incomplete)
- Bulk classification (API exists, no UI)
- Export functionality (not implemented)
- Compliance tools (not implemented)
- Mobile responsiveness (partial)

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 App Router
- TypeScript
- Ant Design 5
- Prisma + PostgreSQL
- Better Auth
- xAI (Grok) for AI classification
- pgvector for HTS embeddings

## Learnings Log

(Add learnings here as stories are completed)

---

## Notes for Future Sessions

1. The classification engine has gone through 10 versions - V10 is current
2. Tariff data is stored in CountryTariffProfile model
3. HTS codes use pgvector for semantic search
4. User tier checking is partial - needs completion
5. Stripe integration is placeholder only
